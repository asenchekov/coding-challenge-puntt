## The Burroughs Test

#### Create a small command line utility to help a small fictional company
#### calculate the dates on which they should pay their sales staff.

#### Company payroll is handled like so:
● Sales staff are paid a regular fixed base salary each month, plus a regular
monthly bonus.

● Base salaries are paid on the last day of each month, unless that day is a
Saturday or Sunday (a weekend), in which case they are paid on the Friday
before the weekend

● On the 15th of each month, bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless
that day is a weekend, in which case they are paid on the first Wednesday
after the 15th.

Your utility should calculate the payment dates for the next 12 months, including the
current month, and output to the screen in a CSV format.

### Steps to run the script
```$ git clone https://github.com/asenchekov/coding-challenge-puntt.git```

```$ npm i```

```$ npm start```
